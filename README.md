# Election-Audit Summary

This script can be used for any election given certain modifications. The script correctly identifies the vote counts, the percentage of votes won in each county and the votes won by each candidate. This script can further illustrate more analysis by giving us an illustration of the percentage of votes won in each county by each candidate. This is useful for election campaign data and can show us the difference between any hand picked votes and the votes tabulated and processed by this script.
